# rust_sql_parser-project
The project involves implementing a SQL parser in Rust. It focuses on parsing SELECT and CREATE statements with FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses. The goal is to develop a tokenizer, a parser, a simple CLI and an error-handling mechanism, all of which are combined in order to evaluate a string from a command-line input and output an SQL statement.
